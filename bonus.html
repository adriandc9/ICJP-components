  <h3>Our casino bonuses</h3>
  <p>Bonuses are an integral part of the VIP Casino experience. We want to offer something to please each and every player, so we have a wide array of bonuses and bonus offers to enjoy. That includes deposit bonuses, Free Spins, Spin Credits and so much more! On this page, we will provide you with all the information you need to help you understand how our bonuses work. The details may vary from one offer to another, so be sure to always check the terms for the specific bonus offer, as well as keeping an eye on our general terms and conditions every time.</p>
  <p>You shouldn’t have to spend all of your leisure time trying to work out complicated bonus rules and regulations, so we’ve done our best to keep our bonuses simple and fun.</p>
  <p>The VIPCasino bonus system works like this: we store your cash and bonus money separately, so you can easily keep an eye on your totals. If you’ve got cash in your account, you can easily see the total and withdraw it whenever you like. If your cash balance reaches 0, that's when your bonus kicks in, giving you an extra chance to try your luck. Each bonus has a specific wagering requirement that has to be met before it's converted into cash. When you reach the specified wagering requirement, your remaining bonus balance will turn into cash that you can withdraw.</p>
